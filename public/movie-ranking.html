<H1>THE BEST SONG TRACKS WHEN YOU ARE AT YOYUR LOWEST</H1>
<h2>My Top 3 suggested tracks to gear u up</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>CATCH THE SUN</h3>
<p>lil baby, this song is one of the greatest songs i would recommend for 65% of youths who are still struggling and looking for ways to pull up but things ways seems to be confusing and i advise u a headset in ur self and stay deep down for the lyrics and msg for u. lol don't mind me.</p>
<h3>SUNSHINE</h3>
<p>ASAKE, This Song really give hope when u feel lonely and you really seems to need somebody to talk to ur hear... I agrred with Asake when he said he's Heavenly sounds from the street, that's how we roll it. </p>
<h3>I KNOW HOW IT FEELS</h3>
<p>Lil baby ft Lil Durk, This songs let you know it's not only you in that situation but you can come out of it and be stronger. lol this song hit crazy and real for my male readers/viewers mostly if u things feel expired or empty or tired.</p>
